📂 The Brief: Group project to create a game to a game jam event that we had 29th of November 2022.

⏳ Time spent / Deadline: 4 weeks

🎯 Goals: Even if it was a group project, I went with a personal recipe bank and set the following goals:

Learn more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Build the score page Shuffle the questions fetched from firebase Randomize the answers fetched from firebase Better understanding of firebase Learn teamwork Using github in group

😬 Description: Welcome to cats of dogstreet. The game for those who like to play several different smaller games inside the original game. You as a cat should try to enter "Dog-street" (wallstreet) and collect as many points (dog bones) as possible to end up on the top 3 list for the candidates. Guess number. Play rock, scissors, bag. Take a question quiz and see how many dog-bones you can collect. Everything displays in a scoreboard when you have the answer.

All the points and the usernames that you submit in the beggining of the game are stored in a Firestore database. You end up in a place where you have to choose doors that we randomized and that will take you to the different games that we made. All the points you collect are saved in the database under your UserName and when you make a mistake in a game, the firestore database sends all the information to our scoreboard which shows the user how it went.
